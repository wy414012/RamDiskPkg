Subject: Re: [edk2] What is the usage of BlockIo2 protocol?
From: Andrew Fish
Date: 11/27/2011 2:43 AM
To: edk2-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

Sergey,

I can answer the general UEFI question. BlockIo2 supports non-blocking disk 
access. BlockIo calls are all blocking. You can do a blocking call from 
BlockIo2 by passing in a NULL event to EFI_BLOCK_IO2_TOKEN.Event. See 
https://edk2.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/edk2/trunk/edk2/MdePkg/Include/Protocol/BlockIo2.h

DiskIo and FileSystem are blocking interfaces, so they don't really need 
BlockIo2. BlockIo2 was added to speed the restore of the hibernation file from 
disk.
